This is my First Website which i had made for the fist time in 2024(1st semester) only using HTML5 & CSS3.
# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website
A clean, modern, and fully responsive **portfolio website** built using **pure HTML and CSS** — no frameworks!  
Designed to showcase your skills, projects, and social profiles in a professional and elegant way.
